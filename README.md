# leaflet-challenge

Background: 
The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. In this challenge, you have been tasked with developing a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.




Challenges: 
I found challenges when connecting the URL to our json file to pull earthquake data from. I am going to do some research and revisit my code again to affectively connect URL to json file to pull from. I have the logic down on creating the visualizations such as connecting URL to pull from using json and then creating my loop and legend for visualization purposes. I just need to fix the issue of correctly plugging in the url into the code.
